Advertisement API with MySQL📚 + Spring-Boot 🚀

This API is developed with the intention of following the best practices 
for RESTFul APIs. It has own MySQL database to save real world advertisements.
Following endpoints are available as of now:
- `/ads` - Return all ads
- `/ads/{categoryName}` - Return all ads classified by the given `categoryName`

Future Tasks:
 - 
 ⭕ Fetch Ads descriptions and more important data for each ad 🔁
 
 ⭕ Scrap ads from external systems by the categories and save them
 
 ⭕ Delete ads older than 1 week
 
 ⭕ Segregate identities for different element tags in external systems
